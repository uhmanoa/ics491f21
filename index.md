## Overview

This ICS 491 is a special topics course that will give you the opportunity to improve your software engineering skills by participating in two hackathons: the five day [2021 Meteor Hackathon](https://impact.meteor.com/hackathon) as well as the month-long [2021 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC)](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/). This class will be held in a completely online manner. Both Hackathons will also be held in a completely online format this year.

The 2021 Meteor Hackathon will start on October 15 and finish on October 20.

The 2021 HACC will start on Saturday, October 23.  There will be workshops during the next two weeks, and the final presentations and judging will occur on Saturday, November 20.

Professor Philip Johnson is running this course. For this course, you will gain facility with your tech stack from August to October 15, then participate in the Meteor Hackathon, then participate in the HACC, then refine one of your applications for the last two weeks of the semester.

To be qualified to take this course, you should have a passion for working with technology, for solving important problems facing Hawaii, and have the time available to work hard and independently from August to December. Ideally, you would have completed ICS 314 or have equivalent web application development experience, but that's not required. If you are taking ICS 314 in Fall 2021, or if you just want to use this opportunity to improve your skills, then you should be good.  If you are not sure whether this class is right for you, feel free to send me (johnson@hawaii.edu) an email.

## Prior results

The Meteor Hackathon is new, so we don't have a track record, but ICS undergraduates have an impressive winning streak at the HACC:

  * [2020 HACC](https://www.ics.hawaii.edu/2020/11/ics-students-sweep-hawaii-annual-code-challenge-again/): First Place ($4000), Second Place ($2000), and Third Place ($1000).

   * [2019 HACC](https://www.ics.hawaii.edu/2019/11/ics-students-win-big-at-hacc/): First Place ($4,000) and Third Place ($1,000).

   * [2018 HACC](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/2018/11/ics-students-win-big-at-2018-hawaii-annual-code-challenge/): First Place ($4,096), Second Place ($2,048), and Fourth Place.

   * [2017 HACC](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/2017/09/ics-teams-win-big-at-hawaii-annual-code-challenge/): First Place ($5,000), Second Place ($3,000), and Top College Team.

So, in addition to improving your software engineering skills, you might win some money! I see no reason for us to not do just as well or better this year.

## Course structure

The course will work like this:

1. **(prior to Aug 22) Register for ICS 491 for Fall 2021.**

2. **(prior to Aug 22) Join the ICS 491F21 Discord Server.** I will send registered students a Discord invite.

3. **(Aug 21 - Oct 15) Warm up your tech stack.** For the Meteor Hackathon, you need a tech stack that supports Meteor application development.  For the HACC, your tech stack should support native mobile app development, as that is the most desired app for HACC.  I assume that everyone in the course has (or will have) Meteor development experience. To warm up the native mobile tech stack, each student must reimplement the functionality of the [BowFolios](https://bowfolios.github.io/) application for a mobile device. Your app can be Android-only, iOS-only, or cross-platform.  You can work alone or in teams for this part of the course.  You will be required to deliver partially working versions on September 15 and September 30. You don't have to have prior experience with native mobile app development; you can use the first two months to teach yourself this skill.  Note that Meteor supports native app development, so you can (if you want) use Meteor for that.

4. **(Oct 18, 11:00pm) Warm Up Portfolio Essay Due.** 30% of your grade will be based upon your warm up application. You will submit your warm up application through an essay in your professional portfolio that describes the application you developed, provides links to the source code (and/or deployed application), what you learned from the experience, and what you personally contributed to the project (if you were working in a team).

4. **(Oct 15 - Oct 20)  Meteor Hackathon.** Participate in the Meteor Hackathon. You can be in a team of up to five students.

4. **(Oct 22, 11:00pm) Meteor Hackathon Portfolio Essay Due.** 20% of your grade will be based upon your Meteor Hackathon application and what you contributed to it. You will submit your application through an essay in your professional portfolio that describes the application you developed, provides links to the source code (and/or deployed application), what you learned from the experience, and what you personally contributed to the project (if you were working in a team).

4. **(Oct 23 - Nov 20) HACC.** Participate in the HACC.  You can be in a team of up to five students, which can be the same or different team members as those you chose for the Meteor Hackathon.

4. **(Nov 23, 11:00pm) HACC Portfolio Essay Due.** 40% of your grade will be based upon your HACC application and what you contributed to it. You will submit your application through an essay in your professional portfolio that describes the application you developed, provides links to the source code (and/or deployed application), what you learned from the experience, and what you personally contributed to the project (if you were working in a team).

6. **(Nov 21 - Dec 10) Application improvement.** Regardless of whether you win or not, from November 21 to the end of the semester, you will continue to work on your application to make it even better.

7. **(Dec 15) Final Essay Due.** The final 10% of your grade for the course will be based upon your final essay, which summarizes what you did to improve your application, as well as your overall thoughts on your experiences during this course.

## Grading

Your grade will be based upon the work you did as represented by the four essays (warm up, Meteor Hackathon, HACC, and Final Essay).

The grading will be as follows:

* A: 90% or better.
* B: 80% - 89%
* C: 70% - 79%
* D: 60% - 69%

## Frequently asked questions

**I'm just a freshman (or just taking ICS 211, or a transfer, etc.)  Am I qualified to participate?**

It doesn't matter what courses you've taken, it just matters that you can code both in Meteor and/or in native mobile apps. One suggestion is to start going through the [Android First App tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp).  If that goes well and you find it interesting and fun, then start working on the reimplementation of BowFolios. If you're feeling comfortable and making progress, then you should be good to go.

There are no "lectures" in this class. You are expected to be able to learn new technologies on your own.

**I'm shy. Do I have to be in a team?**

Yes.  You have to be in at least a team of two. You'll thank me for this later.

**What if my team breaks up at the end of the HACC?**

If you are working with a team in which you are the only ICS 491 member, and the team breaks up at the end of HACC, then you can continue to work on the project by yourself for the remainder of the semester.

**I want to be in a team that's larger than five people. Is that OK?**

No, the maximum team size is five.

**I have another question?**

Feel free to email Philip Johnson (johnson@hawaii.edu) with your questions or concerns.
